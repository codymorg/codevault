  * Project Euler Solutions
  * Author : Cody Morgan
  * Brief  : This is a collection of my solutions to ProjectEuler
  *          and Leetcode problems mostly done for fun
  *          This was orginally done in C# 2013 while I was deployed with the 
  *          Army but I was a young and reckless programmer so now I'm doing 
  *          it the right way - or at least a better way
